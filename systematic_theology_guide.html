                <h2 class="section-title">Introduction to Systematic Theology</h2>
                <p>Systematic theology is the study of what the whole Bible teaches on key topics (often called doctrines) and how those truths fit together. Instead of reading Scripture in chronological order, systematic theology organizes beliefs by theme â€“ for example, gathering everything the Bible says about God, or about salvation, into a coherent summary.</p>
                
                <p>This approach helps answer life's big questions â€“ Who is God? Why are we here? What is God's plan for the world? â€“ in a unified way. In short, theology means "studying God" and all that He has revealed about Himself and His purposes. Every Christian is a "theologian" at some level, because what we believe about God affects how we live.</p>

We cover the idea of revelation (God making Himself known) in two ways: general revelation (God's self-disclosure in nature and conscience) and special revelation (God's direct communication, now recorded in Scripture).</p>

                    <p>In Week 7, we study Pneumatology, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is sometimes called the "forgotten" member of the Trinity, so we give special attention to who the Spirit is and what He does in a believer's life. Key topics include regeneration, sanctification, and spiritual gifts.</p>

This includes the second coming of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and final judgment. At its core, eschatology is about hope: God wins and justice is done.</p>

            <h2>Focus on Eschatology â€“ Digging Deeper into the End Times</h2>
            <p>Eschatology can be one of the most fascinating doctrines for new students â€“ and one of the most confusing! In this special focus section, we provide guidance for going deeper on the end times in a healthy, beginner-friendly way.</p>
            
            <div class="book-recommendation">
                <h4>Keep the "Main Hope" in View</h4>
                <p>All Christians share a common hope regarding the end times: Jesus will return, evil will be defeated, God's justice will prevail, and God's people will enjoy His presence forever. Any deeper study of eschatology should keep these core truths front and center.</p>

            <div class="book-recommendation">
                <h4>Understanding Different Views Charitably</h4>
                <p>Sincere Christians interpret some prophetic details differently. If you want to dig into these views, approach the topic with humility and an open mind. A recommended beginner resource is "A Basic Guide to Eschatology" by Millard J. Erickson which outlines the major positions side by side.</p>

                <h4>Life After "The End"</h4>
                <p>A wonderful aspect of eschatology to explore is what happens after Christ returns â€“ namely, the doctrine of the new creation. "Surprised by Hope" by N.T. Wright challenges popular folk ideas about heaven and emphasizes that the ultimate Christian hope is bodily resurrection and the renewal of the whole world.</p>
