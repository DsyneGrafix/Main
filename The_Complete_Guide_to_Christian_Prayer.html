    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Sanctuary -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a thematic, single-page structure with a top navigation bar for easy access to key sections: Foundations, Methods, Tools, Challenges, and Traditions. This non-linear design was chosen over a simple scroll to prevent overwhelming the user with dense text. It allows users to explore topics based on their interest, promoting engagement. Key interactions include clicking on cards to reveal detailed prayer methods and using tabs to compare denominational traditions, making the information digestible and interactive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: ACTS Model (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication). Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz: Doughnut Chart. Interaction: Static visualization within an interactive card that reveals the model's text. Justification: The doughnut chart visually represents the four equal, balanced components of the ACTS prayer model, providing a quick conceptual anchor for the user. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
    - Report Info: Denominational Traditions. Goal: Compare. Presentation: Tabbed Interface. Interaction: Clicking a tab reveals the content for that tradition. Justification: Tabs are a standard, intuitive UI pattern for comparing distinct but related sets of information, avoiding a long, hard-to-scan table. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
    - Report Info: Hindrances to Prayer. Goal: Inform. Presentation: Interactive Accordion/List. Interaction: Clicking a hindrance title expands to show the description. Justification: An accordion is more engaging and less cluttered than a static table, allowing users to focus on one obstacle at a time. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.

            <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                This section explores the core essence of prayer as a dynamic, Trinitarian dialogue with God. It's not about changing God's mind, but about aligning our hearts with His will and purpose. We'll look at the foundational template Jesus provided and understand why prayer is considered the vital breath of the Christian life.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Prayer is fundamentally a conversation with God, a dialogue that transforms the one who prays. Its purpose is not merely to present a list of requests, but to participate in God's redemptive work by aligning our desires with His promises. Christian prayer is uniquely Trinitarian: addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son, and empowered by the Holy Spirit. This act of surrender and relationship is the key to spiritual formation.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#8C6B5D] mb-3">The Lord's Prayer: A Core Template</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        When the disciples asked Jesus, "Teach us to pray," He gave them the Lord's Prayer. This isn't just a script to recite, but a complete model for all prayer. It guides us through a balanced structure: beginning with adoration ("Hallowed be your name"), moving to surrender ("Your kingdom come"), then to supplication ("Give us our daily bread"), and finally to repentance ("Forgive us our sins"). It's the foundational grammar for both formal and spontaneous prayer.

                        <p>This is a simple yet profound way to pray when you're not sure where to start. You simply read a passage of Scripture and rephrase it as a prayer for yourself or someone else. For example, reading Psalm 23, you might pray, "Lord, be my shepherd today, lead me beside quiet waters and restore my soul." This ensures your prayers are grounded in and aligned with God's revealed Word.</p>
