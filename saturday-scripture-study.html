        <!-- THEOLOGICAL INSIGHTS -->
        <div class="study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">‚õ™ Theological Insights</h2>
            <p>The Passover reveals God as both judge and deliverer, executing justice while providing salvation through substitutionary sacrifice. The lamb's blood on the doorposts created a boundary between judgment and mercy, demonstrating that God's wrath against sin must be satisfied, but can be diverted through an acceptable sacrifice. This principle of substitution - the innocent dying for the guilty - becomes the foundation for understanding all biblical sacrifice.</p>
            
            <p>The detailed instructions for the Passover meal established it as a perpetual ordinance, linking remembrance with redemption. Unlike other ancient religious festivals that celebrated natural cycles, Passover commemorated a specific historical act of divine intervention. This event marked Israel's birth as a nation, transforming a group of slaves into God's chosen people through an act of divine grace rather than human achievement.</p>
            
            <p>The timing proves significant - Passover occurred at night, in darkness, when death stalked the land. Yet for those under the blood's protection, it became a night of salvation rather than judgment. The meal eaten in haste, with staff in hand and sandals on feet, portrayed readiness for God's deliverance even before it fully manifested. Faith acted on God's promise before seeing its fulfillment.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- CULTURAL BACKGROUND -->
        <div class="study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">üèõÔ∏è Cultural Background</h2>
            <p>In Egyptian culture, lambs held special significance as symbols of purity and were associated with various deities. The sacrifice of a lamb - particularly during the month when Egyptians typically honored their gods - represented a direct challenge to Egyptian religious authority. The blood on the doorposts, visible to all, declared allegiance to Yahweh rather than Pharaoh, who was considered divine.</p>
            
            <p>The unleavened bread reflected practical urgency - there was no time for bread to rise - but also symbolized purity and separation from Egypt's corruption. Leaven often represented sin or contamination in Hebrew thought, so eating unleavened bread signified leaving behind the old life of bondage. The bitter herbs reminded participants of slavery's bitterness, ensuring that freedom was never taken for granted.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW TESTAMENT CONNECTION -->
        <div class="connection-box">
            <div class="connection-title">üîó The Ultimate Passover Lamb</div>
            <p>The New Testament explicitly identifies Jesus as "our Passover lamb" (1 Corinthians 5:7). John the Baptist's declaration, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), directly echoes Passover imagery. Jesus was crucified during Passover week, and His blood serves the same protective function as the original Passover blood - it causes God's judgment to "pass over" those who trust in Christ's sacrifice.</p>
            
            <p>Every detail finds fulfillment in Christ: the unblemished lamb (Jesus' sinlessness), the shed blood (His crucifixion), the protection from judgment (justification), and the hasty departure (believers' separation from the world system). The Lord's Supper, instituted during a Passover meal, transforms the ancient feast into a Christian ordinance of remembrance and anticipation.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- MODERN APPLICATION -->
        <div class="study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">üéØ Modern Application</h2>
            <p>Like the Israelites in Egypt, believers today live as strangers in a foreign land, awaiting God's final deliverance. The Passover's message remains urgent: only those covered by the blood escape judgment. Personal righteousness, religious activity, or good intentions provide no protection - only the applied blood of the sacrifice avails. This truth challenges every form of works-based salvation.</p>
            
            <p>The Passover meal's emphasis on remembrance teaches modern believers the importance of regularly recalling God's saving acts. Just as Jewish families retell the Exodus story annually, Christians benefit from frequently rehearsing the gospel narrative. Memory serves faith, and faith strengthens through remembrance of God's past faithfulness.</p>
            
            <p>The ready posture - eating with sandals on and staff in hand - calls believers to maintain readiness for Christ's return. This involves both practical preparation (living righteously) and spiritual alertness (watching and praying). The first Passover came suddenly, after long bondage; Christ's return will likewise come suddenly, after a long wait.</p>
