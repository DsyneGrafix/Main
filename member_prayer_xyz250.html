    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Sanctuary -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a thematic, single-page structure with a top navigation bar for easy access to key sections: Foundations, Methods, Tools, Challenges, and Traditions. This non-linear design was chosen over a simple scroll to prevent overwhelming the user with dense text. It allows users to explore topics based on their interest, promoting engagement. Key interactions include clicking on cards to reveal detailed prayer methods and using tabs to compare denominational traditions, making the information digestible and interactive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: ACTS Model (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication). Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz: Doughnut Chart. Interaction: Static visualization within an interactive card that reveals the model's text. Justification: The doughnut chart visually represents the four equal, balanced components of the ACTS prayer model, providing a quick conceptual anchor for the user. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
    - Report Info: Denominational Traditions. Goal: Compare. Presentation: Tabbed Interface. Interaction: Clicking a tab reveals the content for that tradition. Justification: Tabs are a standard, intuitive UI pattern for comparing distinct but related sets of information, avoiding a long, hard-to-scan table. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
    - Report Info: Hindrances to Prayer. Goal: Inform. Presentation: Interactive Accordion/List. Interaction: Clicking a hindrance title expands to show the description. Justification: An accordion is more engaging and less cluttered than a static table, allowing users to focus on one obstacle at a time. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.

                Two pivotal events in history created the foundational splits in Christianity. These schisms, driven by a mix of theology, politics, and culture, set the stage for the denominational landscape we see today. Explore the timeline to understand these key moments.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The formal break between the Western (Roman Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) churches. This was the result of centuries of growing political and theological disagreements, particularly over papal authority and the *Filioque* clause in the Nicene Creed. This event solidified two distinct centers of Christian power and tradition.</p>

Aided by the printing press, the Reformation emphasized "Scripture Alone" (*sola scriptura*), leading to a rejection of papal authority and the creation of thousands of new denominations across Western Europe and beyond.</p>

                The principle of "Scripture Alone" led to great diversity within Protestantism itself.

Modeled by Jesus Christ himself, it involves entering into the pain and reality of another's situation and pleading their cause. This powerful discipline transforms the intercessor, cultivating a heart of compassion, love, and humility, shifting focus from self to God's heart for others.</p>

You simply read a passage of Scripture and rephrase it as a prayer for yourself or someone else. For example, reading Psalm 23, you might pray, "Lord, be my shepherd today, lead me beside quiet waters and restore my soul." This ensures your prayers are grounded in and aligned with God's revealed Word.</p>
